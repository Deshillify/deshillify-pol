# Deshillify


## Overview

**Des*hill*ify**, the community thread hider for /pol/. After installation, an option to declare a thread or post a shill appears in your reply box.  It will post a code (currently 9B3E595A37AE4682BA443FDB6595B110) that other users of the addon will be able to detect and auto-hide any threads containing the code.

## Installation

## TODO / Issues
